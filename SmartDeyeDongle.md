### What you need to have already:
* You need to be running a 5kW/8kW/16kW single phase Deye/Sunsynk inverter.
(Master/Slave & 3Phase not currently supported, Split still in planning phase) (will be released once tested)
* You need to run your own home assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) on an old PC/VM/Laptop/Rasp Pi or similar must support 64bit.
* You need to have a 2.4GHz wifi network at the inverter with reasonable network coverage.

#### Not included (must supply your own):
* You need to have an old micro-USB (type B  )   phone charger to supply power, even if it is a slo-o-o-ow charger, 500mA it is fine. These are still common even today for most electronic devices

### Cost
Price=ZAR 700 (EFT) + Courier( ZAR 100)/You collect(free)  
Comes with RJ45 network cable (30cm)  that has been plugged into an inverter and verified to be working without issues. Also protected with a heat-shrink cover.
