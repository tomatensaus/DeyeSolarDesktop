The smartDeyeDongle contains all the decoding logic for the inverter and will give you a seamless integration into Home Assistant and the DeyeSolarDesktop

What you need to have already:

You need to be running a 5kW/8kW/16kW single phase Deye/Sunsynk inverter.   (Master/Slave & 3Phase not currently supported)
You need to run your own home assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) on an old PC/VM/Laptop/Rasp Pi or similar must support 64bit. (I even managed to get it running on a netbook from 2010 that does not support UEFI boot, works great for home assistant).
You need to have a 2.4GHz wifi network at the inverter with reasonable network coverage.
Not included (must supply your own):

You need to have an old micro-USB (type B  )   phone charger to supply power, even if it is a slo-o-o-ow charger, 500mA it is fine. These are still common even today for most electronic devices
